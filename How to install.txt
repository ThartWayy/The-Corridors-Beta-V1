How to play (From 0)

What you need to play
 - Python to interpret the code
 - A Code Editor to read the code using the python because the dafault python terminal couldn't read unicode emojis..
    - I used Visual Studio Code in this installation guide. (No idea if anything else works)
 - A keyboard Module for fluid gameplay
 - Pip, a package installer to install the keyboard module
 - Mental Endurance and time

------------------------------------------ Installing VSC code

1) Install python
https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
if it says "Add to Path", tick it the box
	To check if your current version is "Added to Path". Open Command Prompt and type in Python
	If Python Is Installed it will show the version Details otherwise It will open Microsoft Store.


2) Install Visual Studio Code (VSC) because the emojis are funny and can't be played straight from the python terminal
https://code.visualstudio.com/

3) Install python extension in VSC so that VSC can do python things.
The extension store is the second bottom button on the left

4) Boot up VSC and select the python extension as the interpreter



------------------------------------------ Installing the Keyboard Module

5) Install pip if it didn't come with python. 

6) type in "pip install pip" into Command Prompt

7) Click the play button on the top right to install pip

8) type "pip install keyboard" into the terminal 

9) open the game file "RobertHuynh" through VSC
